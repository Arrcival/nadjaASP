# Nadja ASP

**This is an outdated project. I totally rewrote the bot back to a .NET console for hosting issues, with an important performance and database interaction gains.**

A discord bot made in ASP.NET for [Black Survival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/690510/Immortal_Soul_Black_Survival/)

*Nadja is the name of the NPC's tutorial*

This repository is outdated as (I was not really good at coding, and it's barely better now) I rewrote it entirely in .NET Core, still using the Discord.NET library.

It requires a database (I might provide the .sql file one day, but it is probably outdated due to the february 2022's patch)

## What does the bot do ?

It shows the item list for a location, the location for an item, items needed for a craft, rates for each items...
It also had a quiz system to guess what item is hidden to craft an item and other misc stuff
